Q11 to Q15 are subjective answer type question. Answer them briefly.

11.  What is Deep Learning?

Ans - Deep learning is a sub set of machine learing works similar to our brain, using a mesh network, technically termed as Deep Neural Network.

12.  What is reinforcement learning?

Ans - Reinforcement learning, in the context of artificial intelligence, is a type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment.

13.  What Are the Differences Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

Ans -Machine Learning (ML) -refers to systems that can learn from experience
     Deep Learning (DL) -refers to systems that learn from experience on large data sets


14.  What is a perceptron?

Ans - A perceptron has a single layer Neural Network and it consist offour main parts input values, weights and bias,net sum , activation function 

15.  What’s the difference between AI and ML?

Ans - Machine learning is part of artificial intelligence. The main difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence is that machine learning enables the system to observe understand by the pattern of the data and give predictable outcomes
 and artificial intelligence enables the system to learn by itself from the pattern and give the result as by working as a human brain.
